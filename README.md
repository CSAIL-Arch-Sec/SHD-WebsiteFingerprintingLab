# Website Fingerprinting Lab

**Learning Objectives**
* Explore a new kind of side channel from a high level language.
* Understand how to reason about the root cause of misleading microarchitectural observations.
* Develop a real-world website fingerprinting attack that works on modern browsers.

**Description**
In this lab, students implement the techniques from our group's ISCA 2022 paper `There's Always a Bigger Fish: A Case Study of a Misunderstood Timing Side Channel`. Students will begin by implementing a seemingly familiar cache-based side channel attack in Javascript, and will then be asked to reason about why this attack works. Then, students will remove a core part of the attack, but see that the code still works.

**Setup**
Students can complete this lab on their own machines. MacOS, Linux, Windows all should work. Google Chrome is required for Part 4 of this lab.
