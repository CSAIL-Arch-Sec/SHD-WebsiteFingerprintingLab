**Use the values printed on the webpage to find the median access time and report your results as follows.**

| Number of Cache Lines | Median Access Latency (ms) |
| --------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 1                     |                            |
| 10                    |                            |
| 100                   |                            |
| 1,000                 |                            |
| 10,000                |                            |
| 100,000               |                            |
| 1,000,000             |                            |
| 10,000,000            |                            |

**According to your measurement results, what is the resolution of your `performance.now()`? In order to measure differences in time with `performance.now()``, approximately how many cache accesses need to be performed?**




## 2-2

**Report important parameters used in your attack. For each sweep operation, you access N addresses, and you count the number of sweep operations within a time interval P ms. What values of N and P do you use? How do you choose N? Why do not you choose P to be larger or smaller?**




## 2-3

**Take screenshots of the three traces generated by your attack code and include them in the lab report.**

![Screenshot of traces](./part2/Screenshot.png)




## 2-4

**Use the Python code we provided in Part 2.1 to analyze simple statistics (mean, median, etc.) on the traces from google.com and nytimes.com. Report the statistic numbers.**




## 2-6

**Include your classification results in your report.**

```

```




## 3-2

**Include your new accuracy results for the modified attack code in your report.**

```

```




## 3-3

**Compare your accuracy numbers between Part 2 and 3. Does the accuracy decrease in Part 3? Do you think that our “cache-occupancy” attack actually exploits a cache side channel? If not, take a guess as to possible root causes of the modified attack.**
